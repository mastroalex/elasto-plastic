# Elasto plastic

- [21 dec](/_nb%20file/first_test/README.md) - Testing for the cinematic hardening introduction.
- 22 dec - Kinematic hardening works. Talked with prof. See [first_test README.md](/_nb%20file/first_test/README.md)

> - [x] Before going on create the two different elements for FEM

- 24 dec - Creation of two different elements: `Q1EPS`  and `Q1EPS2` and done patch test.
  
> - [x] Before going one transform the notebook to easly select `Q1EPS` or `Q1EPS2`. Use procedure with `isotropic`/`cinematic`.

- [1 gen](/_nb%20file/test/README.md) - Created `Q1EPS2`. Implemented stress factor calculation.
- 26 gen - Other test and implmented `AnimationOfResponse[]`to export mp4 video of deformation
